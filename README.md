# Coco Guard

## Purpose 
The purpose of the Coco Guard app is to empower farmers with intelligent tools for identifying coconut tree diseases, forecasting coconut demand, and predicting coconut yield, enabling data-driven decision-making to optimize farming and trade practices. This app is motivated by the current challenges in Sri Lanka, where coconut harvesting is declining due to diseases and rising coconut prices, impacting both local consumption and export opportunities. By providing advanced solutions, Coco Guard aims to help develop the export market, support Sri Lanka's economy, and offer a valuable resource for coconut farmers not only in Sri Lanka but also worldwide.

## Features

### 1. Upload coconut tree images and identify diseases
The **Coco Guard** app is designed to help farmers identify diseases affecting coconut trees. Farmers can upload images of their coconut trees, and the app utilizes a trained object detection model (in the computer vision category) to identify diseases. Once a disease is detected, the app provides detailed descriptions of the symptoms and appropriate treatments. Additionally, farmers can create personalized treatment plans using the app's **Gemini AI-powered treatment suggestion feature**, ensuring effective management of diseases.

#### Description:
The screenshot below shows the accuracy levels of the trained model for disease detection in coconut trees. The model's performance is measured by its ability to accurately identify diseases based on uploaded images. Higher accuracy levels indicate the model's effectiveness in detecting various coconut tree diseases.

### 2. Coconut Demand Forecasting
The app offers a robust coconut demand forecasting feature. By inputting key parameters such as:
- **Month**
- **Region**
- **Coconut Export Volume (kg)**
- **Domestic Coconut Consumption (kg)**
- **Coconut Prices (Local) (LKR/kg)**
- **International Coconut Prices (USD/kg)**
- **Export Destination Demand (kg)**
- **Currency Exchange Rates (LKR to USD)**
- **Competitor Countries' Production (kg)**

The app predicts the demand for coconuts in a specific region and month. This feature is powered by a trained machine learning model, enabling users to make informed decisions for export and local market strategies.

#### Description:
The accuracy level of the coconut demand forecasting model is displayed in the screenshot below.R² Score: 0.999
This is an excellent result. An R² score close to 1 indicates that the model is explaining almost all of the variance in the data. A score of 0.999 means that the model's predictions are extremely close to the actual values, suggesting very high accuracy.

### 3. Coconut Yield Prediction
Coco Guard also includes a coconut yield prediction feature. By inputting the following parameters:
- **Soil Type**
- **Soil pH**
- **Humidity**
- **Temperature**
- **Sunlight Hours**
- **Month**
- **Plant Age**

The app predicts the coconut yield for the specified conditions. This feature helps farmers optimize their agricultural practices based on accurate data-driven insights.

#### Description:
The screenshot below shows the accuracy level of the trained model for predicting coconut yield. It reflects how effectively the model estimates the yield based on various environmental factors

### 4. Data Analysis and History Records
Users can save the parameters and predictions for both yield and demand in dedicated history pages:
- **Yield Records**
- **Demand Records**

These records allow farmers to analyze trends and make better decisions for future farming and trade activities.
