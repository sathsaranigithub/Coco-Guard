# Coco Guard

## Features

### 1. Image Load and Disease Identification
The **Coco Guard** app is designed to help farmers identify diseases affecting coconut trees. Farmers can upload images of their coconut trees, and the app utilizes a trained object detection model (in the computer vision category) to identify diseases. Once a disease is detected, the app provides detailed descriptions of the symptoms and appropriate treatments. Additionally, farmers can create personalized treatment plans using the app's **Gemini AI-powered treatment suggestion feature**, ensuring effective management of diseases.

### 2. Coconut Demand Forecasting
The app offers a robust coconut demand forecasting feature. By inputting key parameters such as:
- **Month**
- **Region**
- **Coconut Export Volume (kg)**
- **Domestic Coconut Consumption (kg)**
- **Coconut Prices (Local) (LKR/kg)**
- **International Coconut Prices (USD/kg)**
- **Export Destination Demand (kg)**
- **Currency Exchange Rates (LKR to USD)**
- **Competitor Countries' Production (kg)**

The app predicts the demand for coconuts in a specific region and month. This feature is powered by a trained machine learning model, enabling users to make informed decisions for export and local market strategies.

### 3. Coconut Yield Prediction
Coco Guard also includes a coconut yield prediction feature. By inputting the following parameters:
- **Soil Type**
- **Soil pH**
- **Humidity**
- **Temperature**
- **Sunlight Hours**
- **Month**
- **Plant Age**

The app predicts the coconut yield for the specified conditions. This feature helps farmers optimize their agricultural practices based on accurate data-driven insights.

### 4. Data Analysis and History Records
Users can save the parameters and predictions for both yield and demand in dedicated history pages:
- **Yield Records**
- **Demand Records**

These records allow farmers to analyze trends and make better decisions for future farming and trade activities.
